# Week 1

Hours spent: ~10h

I, foolishly, assumed the deadline for these weekly reports was a week after the beginning lecture, so unfortunately this one will be late.

## What I achieved this week

* After having many, not so great, ideas, I finally landed on text compression
* I managed to write some early documentation and initialize the poetry project
* I briefly studied the different algorithms needed for text compression

## Plans for next week

Dive much more deeply into the theory of text compression and hopefully get some basic runnable code done.
