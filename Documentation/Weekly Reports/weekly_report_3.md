## What I achieved this week

Had a bit less time than usual this week, so wasn't able to make as much progress as I had wished.

* Managed to get the Huffman encoding working.

## What I've had trouble with

* decoding the .bin file has proven to be somewhat difficult. (Working with bytes is pretty new to me)

## Plans for next week

* Polish the encoding and finish the decoding
* More tests
